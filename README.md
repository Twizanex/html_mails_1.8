HTML Mails
==========

An Elgg 1.8 port of the html_mails plugin originally written by Condiminds.

I needed this for a project, and there didn't seem to be an existing 1.8 port, so...

Installation
------------

Follow the usual Elgg module installation practices, I.e. put the directory in your /mod.

Usage
-----

This plugin provides a number of views in html_mails_1.8/views/default/html_mails which provide the html wrappers for the various messages.

Condiminds have created examples, but you probably want to create your own templates. Bare in mind that html in emails tends to be a little twitchy, so follow the published guidelines!
